	  This document describes a core set of security requirements for 3 different flavors of a Retransmission device. 
	  They will be referred to as RD, ERD and HWS-ERD (Retransmission Device, Encrypting Retransmission Device and 
	  Hardware Separated Encrypting Retransmission Device respectively). These are small form factor devices to 
	  provide isolation, authentication and/or confidentiality for a EUD or set of EUD’s that must interoperate with 
	  an Untrusted Domain. The main goal of the RD use case is to provide network transport and simple isolation of 
	  the EUD. The ERD use case is intended to provide a layer of confidentiality and authentication through a layer 
	  of encryption on top of the existing network transport. The HWS-ERD use case is intended to provide the most 
	  robust isolation between the network transport and EUD on top of the encryption of the ERD.   
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		<b xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">RD</b><p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		The basic RD is a lightweight computing device that acts as both as a retransmission device and a boundary. 
		The RD sits between a EUD (End User Device) and the untrusted transport network as illustrated in Figure 1. 
		The interconnect IC1 between the EUD and the RD is always a wire. The connection IC2 to the transport network 
		can be any media, wire or wireless. IC1 and IC2 may or may not be in the same network address space.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <center xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="figure" id="figure-1"><img id="1" src="images/esr_figure1.svg" width="500em" height="150em"></img><p></p><span class="ctr" data-myid="figure-1" data-counter-type="ct-figure">Figure <span class="counter">1</span></span>:
      </div></center>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  Figure 2 illustrates the RD as a boundary filter implemented as a stateless firewall. FW2 is filtering untrusted 
	  traffic on IC2 and FW1 is filtering EUD traffic on IC1. The FW could be the same application or 2 separate 
	  applications. It may filter in one or both directions if IC1 or IC2. 
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <center xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="figure" id="figure-2"><img id="2" src="images/esr_figure2.svg" width="500em" height="150em"></img><p></p><span class="ctr" data-myid="figure-2" data-counter-type="ct-figure">Figure <span class="counter">2</span></span>:
      </div></center>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  The RD can be managed through one of the following methods: local management through a dedicated management 
	  interface, managed through the WAN interface from a trusted management service or from the LAN interface.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <b xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">ERD</b>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  The ERD is an RD with the additional capability to encrypt all traffic from the EUD through the LAN interface to 
	  form an encrypted tunnel to another encryption end-point through the ERD’s WAN interface. This ensures that all 
	  traffic from the EUD is encrypted coming from the EUD and is intended to protect this traffic over an untrusted 
	  network.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  Figure 3 illustrates the ERD as a dedicated encryption layer. The encryption can be link layer oriented 
	  (i.e. MACsec), network layer oriented (i.e. IPsec) or may even be the Wi-Fi link itself assuming that it is 
	  connecting to a trusted WLAN Access System.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <center xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="figure" id="figure-3"><img id="3" src="images/esr_figure3.svg" width="500em" height="150em"></img><p></p><span class="ctr" data-myid="figure-3" data-counter-type="ct-figure">Figure <span class="counter">3</span></span>:
      </div></center>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <b xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">HWS-ERD</b>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  An HWS-ERD will encrypt traffic between two endpoints and convert traffic from one network media to another 
	  network media while maintaining a defined physical and logical protocol break between the trusted and the 
	  untrusted trusted domains. This forms the most complete security argument for isolation, authentication and 
	  confidentiality of the 3 use cases. Additionally, a HWS-ERD is cryptographically bonded to another HWS-ERD and 
	  once bonded they are meant to only work as a pair to create and manage a point to point encrypted tunnel as 
	  illustrated in Figure 4.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <center xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="figure" id="figure-4"><img id="4" src="images/esr_figure4.svg" width="500em" height="150em"></img><p></p><span class="ctr" data-myid="figure-4" data-counter-type="ct-figure">Figure <span class="counter">4</span></span>:
      </div></center>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  A more granular view of an HWS-ERD pair is in Figure 5. An HWS-ERD consists of at least 2 physically separate 
	  computing units whose functionality is Encryption and Communication respectively. They will be referred to as 
	  Encryption Unit (EU) and Communication Unit (CU) or NID (Network Interface Device).
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <center xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="figure" id="figure-5"><img id="5" src="images/esr_figure5.svg" width="700em" height="250em"></img><p></p><span class="ctr" data-myid="figure-5" data-counter-type="ct-figure">Figure <span class="counter">5</span></span>:
      HWS-ERD end to end view</div></center>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  The EU and CU are physically independent. They must not share any hardware such as memory, cache, or other 
	  internal infrastructure typical of computers. They must not run from a common software image. Examples that meet 
	  this requirement might be a pair of SoC’s, each running an Operating System, or a microProcessor and a 
	  microController, or an FPGA and a microProcessor. A pair of virtual machines running on a single computer does 
	  not meet this separation requirement.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  The CU interface at IC3 could be wireless (Bluetooth, WiFi, 5G, Microwave, etc.) or wired 
	  media (ethernet, fiber, USB, serial, etc.) depending on specific use case. There is no restriction. For example, 
	  where the Untrusted domain is an Ethernet:IP based network, the CU would need an RJ45 interface. That interface 
	  is then assigned an IP address and the destination IP address of its peer CU is assigned to the function that 
	  transfers packets to and from the EU. The Untrusted domain (not the CU) will handle the routing between ERD’s. 
	  The CU functions as a translation layer between IC 3 and IC 2 as well as a network interface to IC 3.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  The IC1 and IC2 is always wired media.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  The EU-to-EU association is a link layer (layer 2) tunnel and not a layer 3 or higher tunnel. However, a 
	  layer 3 (or higher) tunnel can independently exist between CU-to-CU to transport the EU-to-EU frames. The 
	  CU-to-CU tunnel is out of scope for this document.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  The CU and EU must be managed independently from the untrusted and trusted domain respectively. There is no 
	  cryptographic bypass. Thus the network address space of IC1 is independent of the network address space of the 
	  IC3. The isolation boundary of IC2 in Figure 5 (intentionally) prevents them from being managed from a common 
	  location. Managing the CU from the trusted domain, either through the EU or around the EU is not in scope of 
	  this document. Because the association is only between a pair of HWS-ERD’s, they can successfully autonomously 
	  manage themselves if that is sufficient for a use case. However, the EU can be manually 
	  managed (from the trusted domain) depending on the use case requirements.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  An even more detailed view of a HWS-ERD in Figure 6 illustrates the protocol break between the black and red 
	  networks that produces a defined, defendable boundary at interface b and a.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  <center xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="figure" id="figure-6"><img id="6" src="images/esr_figure6.svg" width="700em" height="300em"></img><p></p><span class="ctr" data-myid="figure-6" data-counter-type="ct-figure">Figure <span class="counter">6</span></span>:
      </div></center>
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	<div class="section" id="usecases">Use Cases</div>
	  This technology has many specific use cases. It can serve as an independent filter to restrict traffic flows in 
	  either direction to the EUD. For encryption purposes, the basic principle is to agnostically inject an 
	  encryption operation transparently between 2 endpoints that already communicate without that encryption 
	  operation. For example, a mobile phone with an ERD in a sleeve (the phone radio is disabled) and a remote 
	  enterprise VOIP service. Or a satellite to a ground station. Or a Satellite-to-Satellite link. An IoT edge 
	  device (e.g. thermostat) to a server. A substation to the main power station. Factory automation between 
	  controller and robot. A UAV to its controller or UAV to UAV. A link between an automobile and the manufacturer 
	  for updates and telemetry. Isolation of a subsystem within a system, e.g. separate the audio ECU from the engine 
	  ECU’s running on the automobile CAN bus. A branch office to another branch office. The EUD in the trusted domain 
	  can be one or many devices. The ERD pair can also act as an additional authentication mechanism since there is a 
	  unique cryptographic association. For example, a service technician can be authenticated when doing remote 
	  maintenance merely by having one end of the ERD pair while the other end is at the ingress point to the system 
	  being maintained.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  It must be noted that as you move from Figure 1 to Figure 6, the level of assurance of the security 
	  arguments (i.e. isolation, authentication and confidentiality) moves from basic to significantly enhanced and 
	  preferred. Figure 2 combined with Figure 3 provides good security. Figure 2 and Figure 3 implemented as 
	  Figure 5/6 provides better security.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  However, in formal Common Criteria evaluations we seek evaluation only of solutions designed to: 1) replace 
	  commercial networking capability internal to an End User Device (EUD) with an external 
	  device (e.g. Ethernet, LTE, Wi-Fi, firewall, etc.) 2) provide an encrypted tunnel to protect data in transit 
	  between EUD’s over said external interface.
	<div class="section" id="resourcesprotected">Resources to be protected</div>
    	  <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
		  	<li>Sensitive data in transit</li>
			<li>Cryptographic key material to perform secure communications</li>
			<li>EU from unauthenticated access</li>
		  </ul>
	<div class="section" id="evaluationboundary">Evaluation Boundary</div> 
	  Referencing Figure 1 and 2 above, the evaluation boundary consists of the applications performing the firewall 
	  functions and network functionality.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  Referencing Figure 3, the evaluation boundary is expanded to include the encryption and cryptographic link 
	  functionality of the ERD which would fall under MACsec, IPsec and WLAN Client.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  Referencing Figure 5 and 6 above, the evaluation boundary consists of the hardware/software within the two 
	  HWS-ERD modules (HWS-ERD 1 and HWS-ERD 1’) as well as the cryptographic link between the modules. Most critical 
	  is the interface infrastructure to process data entering and leaving EU1 and EU1’ within the blue dashed box.
	  <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
	  What is not in the evaluation boundary is the EUD or the CU in the case of the HWS-ERD.
